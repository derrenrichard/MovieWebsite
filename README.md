# 🎬 Movie Watchlist APEX App

A web application built to help you discover and keep track of movies you want to watch or have already seen.  
This project leverages the power of **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** and the **Oracle APEX low-code platform** to deliver a seamless user experience, with movie data provided by **The Movie Database (TMDB)**.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This application was built using a modern, cloud-based stack:

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| ☁️ **Cloud Platform** | Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) |
| 🧩 **Application Framework** | Oracle APEX (low-code platform) |
| 🗄️ **Database** | Oracle Autonomous Database |
| 🎥 **External Data Source** | The Movie Database (TMDB) API |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The front-end interface is built and rendered by **Oracle APEX**.  
2. When a user searches for a movie, **APEX makes a REST API call** to the **TMDB API** to retrieve movie data.  
3. When a user adds a movie to their watchlist, its ID and associated data are **stored in the Oracle Database** on OCI.  
4. The **“My Watchlist”** page queries this local database to display the user’s curated list.
